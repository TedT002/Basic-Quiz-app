ngrok was used for the server, 
react was used for the frontend, 
and python (flask) was used for the backend.

One day, I sat down and decided 
I wanted to make my own app for classroom activities instead of Kahoot, and I got started.

But I couldnt fix the error in the leaderboard, so my application couldn't be completed.
